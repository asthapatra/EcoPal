								<p style = "font-weight:90 ;font-size:17px; font-style: normal; text-align:justify"> In the last 20 years, clothing production has roughly doubled. Consequently, 85% of all textiles used for production go to the landfill each year. Currently, the clothing industry is responsible for 10% of the planetâ€™s carbon emissions each year which is more than all emissions released from international flights and maritime shipping trips combined. Fast fashion, which is inexpensive and unethical clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends, is one of the leading causes of this severe increase in environmental pollution. Clothing brands such as Forever-21, Shein, and Zara are known as fast-fashion companies that exploit their factory workers in order to make money. Because many of the fast-fashion clothing pieces are made from cheap fabric, they tend to last a significant amount of less time compared to clothing made from higher quality fabric and get tossed out in a shorter timespan. As a result, the consumer has to have more frequent shopping trips over the course of a year in order to replenish their closet. However, this leads to a consumption-based mindset that fuels the overproduction of clothing in factories. In addition to being detrimental to the environment, it severely jeopardizes the health of the garment factory workers. Although we, as consumers, may not be able to see the effect fast fashion has on the livelihoods of individuals, they still exist and should not go ignored. </p>

								<p style = "font-weight:90 ;font-size:17px; padding-top: 25px ;font-style: normal; text-align:justify">If we continue to have the same mindset about quantity-based consumption we will always be in an endless loop, like the dominos above, while negatively affecting those who make our clothes. However, in the last couple of years, there has been a change where more emphasis is being placed on buying second-hand and finding better clothing alternatives. A greater amount of individuals are beginning to advocate towards slow fashion and are pulling away from a quantity-based mindset. Hopefully, as slow fashion evolves in the future it will eventually just become known as fashion!</p>
